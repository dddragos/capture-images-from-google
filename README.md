# capture-images-from-google

Captures images from Google from a list of names (from a CSV document) and saves them to a new CSV file. 

This Python code uses BeautifulSoup4 to extract the first image/s found on Google for each of the search criteria in a CSV file. 
It also adds all the images to a new CSV document. 

Google might block your connection after about 1,000 downloads. You can get around the issue by adding random delay (included in the code) or you can continue downloading using a VPN. More code instructions written in the file.
